# Intro

> Kubernetes uses `API resource objects` to represent the intended state of everything in the cluster. All administrative tasks require creating, viewing, and changing the `API resources`. Use the oc api-resources command to view the Kubernetes resources.

> every k8s resource has *kind*, *apiVersion*, *spec* and status fields. The *status* field is generated by the k8s

> almost every k8s object includes two nested object fields: `spec` and `status`. The `spec` field contains the desired state, and the `status` field contains the current state.

# Resource types

# RHOCP specific resource types

* BuildConfig
* DeploymentConfig - deprecated
* Route
* ImageStream


# Operators

>**Operators** automate the required tasks to maintain a healthy RHOCP cluster that would otherwise require human intervention. Operators are the preferred method of packaging, deploying, and managing services on the control plane.

* Cluster Version Operator (CVO) - `kind` value of **clusteroperators**

```sh
oc get clusteroperators

describe clusteroperators operator-name

oc get clusteroperators dns -o yaml
```
* Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators

```sh
oc get operators
```

> Operators use one or more pods to provide cluster services

```sh
oc get pods -n openshift-dns-operator
```
