## Ansible CLI

### ad hoc ansible commands

```sh

```sh
ansible -i inventory localhost -m setup
ansible-navigator run -m stdout site.yml --syntax-check
```

### inventory

```sh
ansible-navigator inventory -m stdout --list
ansible-inventory --list
ansible-inventory --graph all
```

### vault

```sh
ansible-vault create secret.yml
ansible-vault create --vault-password-file=vault-pass secret.yml

ansible-vault view secret1.yml
ansible-vault edit secret.yml

ansible-vault encrypt secret1.yml secret2.yml
ansible-vault decrypt secret1.yml --output=secret1-decrypted.yml

ansible-vault rekey secret.yml
```

prompt for the password

```sh
ansible-navigator run -m stdout --playbook-artifact-enable false create_users.yml --vault-id @prompt
ansible-navigator run -m stdout create_users.yml --vault-password-file=vault-pass
```

## config

* /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg # system wide
* ~/.ansible.cfg # home directory
* ./ansible.cfg # current directory

### ansible.cfg example

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = root
host_key_checking = False
retry_files_enabled = False
roles_path = ./roles
library = ./library
module_utils = ./module_utils
callback_whitelist = profile_tasks
[privilege_escalation]
become = True
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = False
```

### ansible-config

show configurations that have changed from the default

```sh
ansible-config dump --only-changed
```

generate ansible.cfg from a template

```sh
ansible-config init
```

## Syntax

### Conditionals

```yaml
---
- name: Simple Boolean Task Demo
  hosts: all
  vars:
    run_my_task: true
  tasks:
    - name: httpd package is installed
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: httpd
      when: run_my_task | bool
```

```yaml
---
- name: Test Variable is Defined Demo
  hosts: all
  vars:
    my_service: httpd
  tasks:
    - name: "{{ my_service }} package is installed"
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: "{{ my_service }}"
      when: my_service is defined
```

greater-thn character (>) used to split the long conditionals over multiple lines

```yaml
when: >
    ( ansible_facts['distribution'] == "RedHat" and
      ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == "9" )
    or
    ( ansible_facts['distribution'] == "Fedora" and
    ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == "34" )
```

these two conditions are equal

```yaml
when: ansible_facts['distribution_version'] == "9.0" and ansible_facts['kernel'] == "5.14.0-70.13.1.el9_0.x86_64"
```

```yaml
when:
  - ansible_facts['distribution_version'] == "9.0"
  - ansible_facts['kernel'] == "5.14.0-70.13.1.el9_0.x86_64"
```

### Loops

```yaml
- name: Postfix and Dovecot are running
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: started
  loop:
    - postfix
    - dovecot
```

```yaml
- name: Users exist and are in the correct groups
  user:
    name: "{{ item['name'] }}"
    state: present
    groups: "{{ item['groups'] }}"
  loop:
    - name: jane
      groups: wheel
    - name: joe
      groups: root
```

```yaml
vars:
  mail_services:
    - postfix
    - dovecot
tasks:
  - name: Postfix and Dovecot are running
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: "{{ item }}"
      state: started
    loop: "{{ mail_services }}"
```

The **register** keyword can also capture the output of a task that loops. The following snippet shows the structure of the **register** variable from a task that loops:

```yaml
---
- name: Loop Register Test
  gather_facts: no
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Looping Echo Task
      ansible.builtin.shell: "echo This is my item: {{ item }}"
      loop:
        - one
        - two
      register: echo_results
    - name: Show echo_results variable
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: echo_results
```

output

```json
{"echo_results": {
        "changed": true,
        "msg": "All items completed",
        "results": [
            {
                "ansible_facts": {
                    "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/local/bin/python3.11"
                },
                "ansible_loop_var": "item",
                "changed": true,
                "cmd": "echo This is my item: one",
                "delta": "0:00:00.014493",
                "end": "2023-03-22 22:14:19.949881",
                "failed": false,
                "invocation": {}}]}}
```

### Earlier-style Ansible loops

| Loop keyword | Description |
|---|---|
|with_items | Behaves the same as the loop keyword for simple lists, such as a list of strings or a list of dictionaries. Unlike loop, if lists of lists are provided to with_items, they are flattened into a single-level list. The item loop variable holds the list item used during each iteration.|
|with_file | Requires a list of control node file names. The item loop variable holds the content of a corresponding file from the file list during each iteration. |
| with_sequence| Requires parameters to generate a list of values based on a numeric sequence. The item loop variable holds the value of one of the generated items in the generated sequence during each iteration.|

### Variables

> Variables priority from top to bottom

* Group variables defined in the inventory
* Group variables defined in files in a group_vars subdirectory in the same directory as the inventory or the playbook
* Host variables defined in the inventory
* Host variables defined in files in a host_vars subdirectory in the same directory as the inventory or the playbook
* Host facts, discovered at runtime
* Play variables in the playbook (vars and vars_files)
* Task variables
* Extra variables defined on the command line

You can define variables for hosts and host groups by creating two directories, _group_vars_ and _host_vars_, in the same working directory as the inventory file or playbook.

```sh
project
├── ansible.cfg
├── group_vars
│   ├── datacenters
│   ├── datacenters1
│   └── datacenters2
├── host_vars
│   ├── demo1.example.com
│   ├── demo2.example.com
│   ├── demo3.example.com
│   └── demo4.example.com
├── inventory
└── playbook.yml
```

set a variable on the command line

```sh
ansible-navigator run main.yml -e "package=apache"
```

define a variable in a playbook or vars_files

```yaml
user1_first_name: Bob
user1_last_name: Jones
user1_home_dir: /users/bjones
user2_first_name: Anne
user2_last_name: Cook
user2_home_dir: /users/acook

users:
  bjones:
    first_name: Bob
    last_name: Jones
    home_dir: /users/bjones
  acook:
    first_name: Anne
    last_name: Cook
    home_dir: /users/acook
```

> reference to the vars_files

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars_files:
    - vars/users.yml
```

> work with dictionaries

```sh
# Ansible way
# Returns 'Bob'
users.bjones.first_name
# Returns '/users/acook'
users.acook.home_dir

# Python way
# Returns 'Bob'
users['bjones']['first_name']
# Returns '/users/acook'
users['acook']['home_dir']
```

### [Magic Variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/special_variables.html)

Hostvars - a dictionary with all the hosts in inventory and variables assigned to them

```sh
hostvars['demo2.example.com']['ansible_facts']['interfaces']
```

group_names - List of groups the current host is part of

groups - a dictionary with all the groups in inventory and each group has the list of hosts that belong to it

inventory_hostname - the inventory name for the ‘current’ host being iterated over in the play

### Handlers and Failure

Handler example

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: copy demo.example.conf configuration template
    ansible.builtin.template:
      src: /var/lib/templates/demo.example.conf.template
      dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/demo.example.conf
    notify:
      - restart apache
handlers:
  - name: restart apache
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
```

ignore_errors

```yaml
- name: Install {{ web_package }} package
  ansible.builtin.dnf:
    name: "{{ web_package }}"
    state: present
  ignore_errors: yes
```

change_when - change the status of the task

```yaml
- name: Check local time
  ansible.builtin.command: date
  register: command_result
  changed_when: false
```

failed_when - define what “failure” means in the task

```yaml
- name: Fail task when the command error output prints FAILED
  ansible.builtin.command: /usr/bin/example-command -x -y -z
  register: command_result
  failed_when: "'FAILED' in command_result.stderr"
```

### Block

block - a way to group tasks together and execute them as a single unit

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Attempt to set up a webserver
    block:
      - name: Install {{ web_package }} package
        ansible.builtin.dnf:
          name: "{{ web_package }}"
          state: present
    rescue:
      - name: Install {{ db_package }} package
        ansible.builtin.dnf:
          name: "{{ db_package }}"
          state: present
    always:
      - name: Start {{ db_service }} service
        ansible.builtin.service:
          name: "{{ db_service }}"
          state: started
```
