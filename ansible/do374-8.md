## Delegating Tasks

In a play, you can delegate a task to run on `another host` instead of the current `managed host`.

`delegate_to` - this directive points Ansible to the host that executes the task instead of the current managed host.

```yaml
---
- name: Delegation Example
  hosts: demo.lab.example.com
  become: false

  tasks:
    - name: Get system information
      ansible.builtin.command: uname -a
      register: managed_host

    - name: Display demo system information
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: managed_host

    - name: Get system information
      ansible.builtin.command: uname -a
      delegate_to: host.lab.example.com
      register: delegated

    - name: Display localhost system information
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: delegated
```

```yaml
- name: Remove the server from HAProxy
    community.general.haproxy:
    state: disabled
    host: "{{ ansible_facts['fqdn'] }}"
    socket: /var/lib/haproxy/stats
    delegate_to: "{{ item }}"
    loop: "{{ groups['lbservers'] }}"

- name: Make sure Apache HTTPD is stopped
    ansible.builtin.service:
    name: httpd
    state: stopped
```

```yaml
- name: Access the web service
    uri:
    url: http://{{ ansible_facts['fqdn'] }}
    timeout: 5
    delegate_to: test-client.example.com
```

## Delegating to Execution Environments

One of the most common uses of delegation is to run tasks on a `control node` instead of a `managed host`.

```yaml
- name: Get information about controller instance
    ansible.builtin.uri:
    url: https://{{ ansible_facts['fqdn'] }}/api/v2/ping/
    method: GET
    validate_certs: no
    return_content: yes
    delegate_to: localhost
    register: controller_ping
```

## Delegating Facts

When you delegate a task, Ansible uses the host variable and facts for the managed host(the current inventory_hostname) for which the task is running.

`delegate_facts` - assigns the facts collected by a `delegated task` to the `host` to which the task was delegated.

```yaml
- name: Delegate Fact Example
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Set a fact in delegated task on demo
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        myfact: Where am I set?
      delegate_to: demo.lab.example.com
      delegate_facts: true

    - name: Display the facts from demo.lab.example.com
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ hostvars['demo.lab.example.com']['myfact'] }}"
```

# Parallelism 

## Forks

When Ansible processes a playbook, it runs each play in order. After determining the list of hosts for the play, Ansible runs through each task in order. Normally, all hosts must successfully complete a task before any host starts the next task in the play.

In theory, Ansible could connect to all hosts in the play simultaneously for each task. This approach works fine for small lists of hosts, but if the play targets hundreds of hosts, it can put a heavy load on the control node.

`forks` - controls the number of hosts that Ansible connects to simultaneously.

```sh
[user@host]$ ansible-navigator config dump -m stdout
...output omitted...
DEFAULT_FORCE_HANDLERS(default) = False
DEFAULT_FORKS(default) = 5
DEFAULT_GATHERING(default) = implicit
...output omitted...
```

## Serial

Normally, when Ansible runs a play, it ensure that all managed hosts complete each task before it starts the next task. After all managed hosts have completed all tasks, then any notified handlers are run.

However, running all tasks on all hosts can lead to undesirable behavior. For example, if a play updates a cluster of load-balanced web servers, it might need to take each web server out of service during the update. If all the servers are updated in the same play, they could all be out of service simultaneously.

`serial` - controls the number of hosts that Ansible connects to simultaneously.

```yaml
# Ansible first runs the tasks (and handlers) on the first two managed hosts
---
- name: Rolling update
  hosts: webservers
  serial:
    - 2
    - 25%
# If unprocessed hosts remain after the last batch corresponding to the previous serial directive entry, the last batch repeats until all hosts are processed.
  tasks:
    - name: Latest apache httpd package is installed
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
      notify: restart apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart apache
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```


## Aborting the Play

`ansible_play_batch` - contains the list of hosts that Ansible is currently processing.

`max_fail_percentage` - specifies the maximum percentage of hosts that can fail before Ansible aborts the play.

To summarize the Ansible failure behavior:

* If the serial directive and the max_fail_percentage values are not defined, all hosts are run through the play in one batch. If all hosts fail, then the play fails.
* If the serial directive is defined, then hosts are run through the play in multiple batches, and the play fails if all hosts in any one batch fail.
* If the max_fail_percentage directive is defined, the play fails if more than that percentage of hosts in a batch fail.

If a play fails, Ansible aborts all remaining plays in the playbook.

## Running a Task Once

`run_once` - runs a task only once(one host per batch), even if the play targets multiple hosts.

```yaml
- name: Reactivate Hosts
  ansible.builtin.shell: /sbin/activate.sh {{ active_hosts_string }}
  run_once: true
  delegate_to: monitor.example.com
  vars:
    active_hosts_string: "{{ ansible_play_batch | join(' ')}}"
# for a case with multiple batches, and you don't need to run a task on each batch.
# when: inventory_hostname == ansible_play_hosts[0]

```
