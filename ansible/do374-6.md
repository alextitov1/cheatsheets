# Controlling Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation directives:
* become
* become_user
* become_method
* become_flags

## Privilege Escalation by Configuration

ansible.cfg
```ini
[privilege_escalation]
become = true
become_user = true
```

| Directive       | Command-line option           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| become          | --become or -b                |
| become_method   | --become-method=BECOME_METHOD |
| become_user     | --become-user=BECOME_USER     |
| become_password | --ask-become-pass or -k       |

## Privilege Escalation in Play, Task, Block and Role

```yml
- name: Example play with one role
  hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - role: role-name
      become: true
```

## Listing Privilege Escalation with Connection Variables

> Connection variables override the become settings in the configuration file, as well as in plays, tasks, blocks, and roles.

| Directive       | Connection variable   |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| become          | ansible_become        |
| become_method   | ansible_become_method |
| become_user     | ansible_become_user   |
| become_password | ansible_become_pass   |

```yml
webservers:
  hosts:
    servera.lab.example.com:
    serverb.lab.example.com:
  vars:
    ansible_become: true
```

# Controlling Task Execution
> In a play, Ansible always runs the tasks from roles, called by the `roles` statement, before the tasks that you define under the `tasks` section.


## Importing or Including Roles as a Task

* `import_role`  - statically imports a role
* `include_role` - dynamically includes a role

## Pre- and Post-tasks

* `pre_tasks` is a tasks section that runs before the **roles** section.
* `post_tasks` is a tasks section that runs after the **task** section and **handlers** notified by tasks

## Reviewing the Order of Execution

Ansible runs the play sections in the following order:

* `pre_tasks`
* Handlers that are notified in the `pre_tasks` section
* `roles`
* `tasks`
* Handlers that are notified in the `roles` and `tasks` sections
* `post_tasks`
* Handlers that are notified in the `post_tasks` section

> To immediately run any handlers that have been notified by a particular task in the play, add a task that uses the meta module with the `flush_handlers` parameter. This enables you to define specific points during task execution when all notified handlers are run.

```yml
---
- name: Updating the application configuration and cache
  hosts: app_servers

  tasks:
    - name: Deploying the configuration file
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: api-server.cfg.j2
        dest: /etc/api-server.cfg
      notify: Restart api server

    - name: Running all notified handlers
      ansible.builtin.meta: flush_handlers

    - name: Asking the API server to rebuild its internal cache
      ansible.builtin.uri:
        url: "https://{{ inventory_hostname }}/rest/api/2/cache/"
        method: POST
        force_basic_auth: true
        user: admin
        password: redhat
        body_format: json
        body:
          type: data
          delay: 0
        status_code: 201

  handlers:
    - name: Restart api server
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: api-server
        state: restarted
        enabled: true
```

# Listening to Handlers

A task can notify multiple handlers in at least two ways:
* It can notify a list of handlers individually by name.
* It can notify one name for which multiple handlers are configured to listen.

```yaml
---
- name: Testing the listen directive
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  become: false

  tasks:
    - name: Trigger handlers
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: Trigerring the handlers
      notify: My handlers
      changed_when: true

  handlers:
    # Listening to the "My handlers" event
    - name: Listening to a notification
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: First handler was notified
      listen: My handlers

    # As an example, this handler is also triggered because
    # its name matches the notification, but no two handlers
    # can have the same name.
    - name: My handlers
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: Second handler was notified
```

# Controlling the Order of Host Execution

> By default, Ansible runs the play against hosts in the order in which they are listed in the inventory. You can change that order on a play-by-play basis by using the `order` directive.

This playbook alphabetically sorts the hosts in the `web_servers` group before running the task:
```yml
---
- name: Testing host order
  hosts: web_servers
  order: sorted  # inventory(default) | sorted | reverse_sorted | reverse_inventory | shuffle

  tasks:
    - name: Creating a test file in /tmp
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        content: 'This is a sample file'
        dest: /tmp/test.out
```

# Tagging Ansible Resources

Tags are available for the following resources:
* plays
* tasks - the most common ways that tags are used
* role
* blocks

Options:
* `--tags`
* `--skip-tags` - skips the tasks that are tagged with the specified tags
* `--list-tags` - lists all tags that are defined in the play


## Special tags

`always` - a resource that is tagged with `always` is always run, regardless if it doesn't match the list of tags passed to the --tags option. The only exception is when it is explicitly skipped with `--skip-tags`.

`never` - a task that you tag with the `never` tag does not run, unless you run the playbook with the `--tags` option set to `never` or to one of the other tags associated with the task.

`tagged` - runs any resource with an explicit tag.

`untagged` - runs any resource that does not have an explicit tag.

`all` - runs all resources, regardless of their tags. This is default behavior of Ansible


# Optimizing Playbook Execution

a way to measure playbook execution time:
```sh
time ansible-navigator run -m stdout  speed_facts.yml -i inventory
```

If `gathering facts` isn't run substitute with magic variables:

* ansible_facts['hostname'] or ansible_hostname - `inventory_hostname`
* ansible_facts['nodename'] or ansible_nodename - `inventory_hostname_short`


## Reusing Gathered Facts with Fact Caching

Ansible uses `cache plug-ins` to store gathered facts or inventory source data gathered by a play

The `memory` cache plug-in is enabled by default

This play book illustrates how cache works:
```yml
- name: Gather facts for everyone
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: true

  # any tasks we might want for the first play
  # if you do not have tasks, "setup" will still run

- name: The next play, does not gather facts
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Show that we still know the facts
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: ansible_facts
```

Another way to use fact caching is to use `smart` gathering.
When enabled, `smart` gathering gathers facts on each new host in a playbook run, but if the same host is used across multiple plays, then the host is not contacted for fact gathering again in the run.

```ini
[defaults]
gathering=smart
```

## Limiting Fact Gathering

```yml
- name: A play that gathers some facts
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Collect only network-related facts
      ansible.builtin.setup:
        gather_subset:
          - '!all'
          - '!min'
          - network
          - hardware
          - virtual
          - ohai
          - facter
```

## Parallelism

```ini
defaults]
forks=100
```
`-f` option can be used to override the default value

## Avoiding Loops with the Package Manager Modules

## Efficiently Copying Files to Managed Hosts

## Using Templates

When used with a loop, the `ansible.builtin.lineinfile` module is inefficient and can be error-prone, use either the `ansible.builtin.template` or `ansible.builtin.copy` module instead.

## Enabling Pipelining

To run a task on a remote node, Ansible performs several SSH operations to copy the module and all its data to the remote node and run the module. To increase the performance of your playbook, you can activate the pipelining feature. With pipelining, Ansible establish fewer SSH connections.

```yml
---
ansible-navigator:
  ansible:
    config: ./ansible.cfg

  execution-environment:
    image: ee-supported-rhel8:latest
    pull-policy: missing
    environment-variables:
      set:
        ANSIBLE_PIPELINING: true
```

Ansible does not use pipelining by default because the feature requires that the `requiretty sudo` option on the remote node be disabled.

## Profiling Playbooks Execution with Callback Plug-ins

Callback plug-ins extend Ansible by adjusting how it responds to various events. Some of these plug-ins modify the output of the command-line tools.

ansible.cfg
```ini
[defaults]
callbacks_enabled=timer, profile_tasks, cgroup_perf_recap
```

```sh
ansible-navigator doc -t callback -l -m stdout

ansible-navigator doc -t callback cgroup_perf_recap -m stdout
```
